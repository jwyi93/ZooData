The average work to achieve a workflow. Classifications and Session represent the average number which appears as the minimum for the classification at a level. Likely over estimated in some cases since users might not know when they've reached a new level. 

```{r promotion2, echo=TRUE}

Read as: 
"The number of annotations in the [insert y-axis workflow] were submitted by N individuals in [insert bar portion]"

```{r promotion3, echo=TRUE}
