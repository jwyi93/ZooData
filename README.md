# Code for Zooniverse Proejcts

My repo for coding projects using data from the Zooniverse citizen science platform (http://www.zooniverse.org). I work with a team of researchers at Syracuse University investigating [learning and motivation in citizen science](http://citsci.syr.edu/content/focusing-attention%C2%A0-improve-performance-citizen-science-systems-beautiful-images-and-percept). Most of my work has been analyzing trace data from various projects on the Zooniverse platform. I haven't done a great job of documenting the code I've written to analyze the data, but you can view some of it in this repo. 

Projects I'm currently working on: 

* Anonymous Contribution (Submitted to CHI)
* Hashtag Evolution 
* Tracking Data (with Amruta)
* Survival
* Gravity Spy ([Mabi Harandi] https://github.com/Harandi6135)

You can view some of our research here: [Citizen Science Research at Syracuse](http://citsci.syr.edu/papers)
